# Spark_Parsers
### Parsers for various kinds of delimited files
* Tab Delimited - read_tab_files.scala

### Script to copy files from an HDFS dir-subdirs to a Destination directory
* copy_files_in_hdfs.py


#### I had to spend time in finding ways to parse various kinds of file to ingest in hadoop
#### This repo is going to be a collection of process/ingest all sorts of files I encounter

#### Plus a few tasks that I may need to do on spark/Hadoop
#### The idea is others may get some answers here and may not have to wander all sorts of places to implement similar things.
